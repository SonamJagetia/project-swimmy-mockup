# Project Swimmy Mockup

At its core, Project Swimmy is an events search platform that connects activists with local organizing groups. More broadly, Project Swimmy exists to enable people who are confronting the need for change to collectively organize. Swimmy aims to build power in communities by bringing people together in groups and building on coalitions and intersection of issues.

See the official [Welcome! Read me first!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bXptxf_nos7lHOdOp-WEWSGkk7VjPxMzH8dKodZyodc/)  document for more info. Note that some info there is outdated.

See the official [UI Mockup](http://bedi.work/swimmy/) for what we want the final MVP to look like.

See the [Trello Swimmy Dev board](https://trello.com/b/UeMUEmNh/swimmy-dev-board) for what needs to be done. This will be the central location for all discussion, issues, and project management.

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.
