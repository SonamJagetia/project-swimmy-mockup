**2017/04/24 Geoffrey Yip: Project Swimmy is not currently in active development. There were a lot of ideas (and confusion) over what this project was supposed to be. Everyone agreed that it would be a tool to enable progressive movements, but beyond that, it was hard for me to find any consensus or clarity. To some, Project Swimmy was a centralized events repository where volunteers could find rallies and meetings near them. To others, it was a gamified platform to motivate community organizers with badges and points. Ultimately, I believe it was this confusion that caused progress to stagnate. To me, Project Swimmy was an events discovery service, that is hackable and integrate-able into other projects. Resistance-calendar is already in active development on events discovery, and Iâ€™ve decided to contribute there instead. If any developers are still following this repo, I encourage you to come join me.**

# Project Swimmy Mockup

At its core, Project Swimmy is an events search platform that connects activists with local organizing groups. More broadly, Project Swimmy exists to enable people who are confronting the need for change to collectively organize. Swimmy aims to build power in communities by bringing people together in groups and building on coalitions and intersection of issues.

See the official [Welcome! Read me first!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bXptxf_nos7lHOdOp-WEWSGkk7VjPxMzH8dKodZyodc/)  document for more info. Note that some info there is outdated.

See the official [UI Mockup](http://bedi.work/swimmy/) for what we want the final MVP to look like.

See the [Trello Swimmy Dev board](https://trello.com/b/UeMUEmNh/swimmy-dev-board) for what needs to be done. This will be the central location for all discussion, issues, and project management.

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.
