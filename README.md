# Project Swimmy Mockup

At its core, Project Swimmy is an events search platform that connects activists with local organizing groups. More broadly, Project Swimmy exists to enable people who are confronting the need for change to collectively organize. Swimmy aims to build power in communities by bringing people together in groups and building on coalitions and intersection of issues.

See the official [Welcome! Read me first!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bXptxf_nos7lHOdOp-WEWSGkk7VjPxMzH8dKodZyodc/)  document for more info. Note that it needs updating.

See the official [mockup](http://bedi.work/swimmy/) for what we want the final MVP to look like.

See the [Trello Swimmy Dev board](https://trello.com/b/UeMUEmNh/swimmy-dev-board) for what needs to be done.

See the CONTRIBUTING.md for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests.
